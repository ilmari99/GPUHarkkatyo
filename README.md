# GPU Computing, project work
This repository is for LUT University GPU Computing course from spring 2024. Two separate task were solved completed in the assignment:
1. Implementation of k-nearest neighbors classifier (kNN) using self-built kernel for the GPU
2. Implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) using GPU-accelerated library

Performance benchmark and comparison between CPU and GPU run times were also conducted.
